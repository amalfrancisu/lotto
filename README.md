The Blockchain is a unique opportunity to create a new, decentralised, casino with no house edge. In this casino, players compete in high-stakes games of chance with each other, not against the operator. The games themselves are provably fair so players never see the likelihood of any outcome change over time. This is an online Casino website made using Decentology's Hyperverse. I have made use of the Tribes module for doing the same.
